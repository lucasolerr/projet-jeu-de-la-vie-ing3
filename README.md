# projet-jeu-de-la-vie-ing3

## Overview
This project implements Conway's Game of Life using Python and Pygame. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on a set of simple rules.

### Objectives

1. Simulation: Create a dynamic and visually appealing simulation of the Game of Life.
2. User Interaction: Allow users to start, stop, and reset the simulation.
3. Customization: Enable users to customize the grid size and initial configuration.

### Key Features

* Real-Time Rendering: Uses Pygame for real-time graphical rendering of the grid.
* Interactive Menu: A menu system to control the simulation's parameters and state.
* Grid Customization: Adjustable grid size and initial cell states.

### Technologies
* Python: Main programming language.
* Pygame: Library for rendering graphics and handling user input.
